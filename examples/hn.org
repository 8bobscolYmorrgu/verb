Accept: application/json

** Item
# Stories, comments, jobs, Ask HNs and even polls are just
# items. They're identified by their ids, which are unique integers,
# and live under /v0/item/<id>.

get /item/{{(read-string "Item ID: ")}}.json?print=pretty

** User
# Users are identified by case-sensitive ids, and live under
# /v0/user/. Only users that have public activity (comments or story
# submissions) on the site are available through the API.

get /user/{{(read-string "User ID: ")}}.json

** Live Data
# The coolest part of Firebase is its support for change
# notifications. While you can subscribe to individual items and
# profiles, you'll need to use the following to observe front page
# ranking, new items, and new profiles.

*** Max Item ID
# The current largest item id is at /v0/maxitem. You can walk backward
# from here to discover all items.
get /maxitem.json

*** Top Stories
get /topstories.json

*** New Stories
get /newstories.json

*** Best Stories
get /beststories.json

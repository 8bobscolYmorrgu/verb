# IDE Fix Pack 5.96: A Must-Have Tool for Delphi 10.2 Tokyo Developers
 
If you are a Delphi 10.2 Tokyo developer, you might want to check out IDE Fix Pack 5.96, a collection of unofficial bug fixes and performance optimizations for the RAD Studio IDE, compiler and debugger. This tool can make your development experience faster, smoother and more enjoyable.
 
IDE Fix Pack is an IDE plugin that fixes some IDE bugs at runtime, without modifying any files on disk or your projects. It also optimizes the compiler's file search algorithm, CodeInsight, the actual compilation and the debugger. It even fixes some memory leaks in the IDE, compiler and debugger.

Some of the features and fixes in IDE Fix Pack 5.96 are:
 
- Support for RAD Studio 10.2 Tokyo
- Disable DynArraySetLength patch if 10.1 Berlin Update 2 is detected
- Disable "clang template debug symbol bloat" for 10 Seattle and newer
- Prevent IDE from shrinking main window to zero size when minimized

IDE Fix Pack also includes a tool called fastdcc, which applies the Compiler Speed Pack on the command line compiler dcc32, dcc64 and dccaarm (XE6 and newer). This can speed up your build process significantly.
 
To install IDE Fix Pack, you just need to run IDEFixPackRegXxx.exe under your user account and select the IDE registry keys for which you want to install the bugfix. To uninstall it, you can run the same executable and press the "Uninstall" button.

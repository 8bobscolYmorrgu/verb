If you are a Christian who wants to deepen your understanding of the historical and cultural context of the Bible, you might be interested in reading *The Hebrew Yeshua Vs. The Greek Jesus Book Pdf* by Nehemia Gordon. This book is a fascinating exploration of the ancient Hebrew text of the Gospel of Matthew, which reveals a different picture of Yeshua (Jesus) than the one we are used to from the Greek translations.
  
In this book, Gordon, a former Pharisee and a Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, shows how the Greek text of Matthew has distorted some of the original meanings and nuances of Yeshua's teachings and actions. He argues that Yeshua was not a blond-haired, blue-eyed Gentile, but an observant Jew who lived in a culture where the Torah (the five books of Moses) was the national constitution. He also explains the life-and-death conflict that Yeshua had with the Pharisees, who were trying to take over Judaism in the first century.

Many readers have found *The Hebrew Yeshua Vs. The Greek Jesus Book Pdf* to be an eye-opening and enlightening book that challenges some of the common assumptions and misconceptions about Yeshua and his message. According to Kirkus Reviews, this book is "a scholarly examination of the theory that Hebrew versions of the Book of Matthew indicate that Jesus, or Yeshua, had beliefs similar to that of the Karaites"[^1^]. The Karaites are a sect of Judaism that rejects the oral traditions of the Pharisees and follows only the written Torah.
  
Some of the topics that Gordon covers in this book include the meaning of the phrase "the seat of Moses", the significance of Yeshua's use of the divine name Yahweh, the difference between "binding and loosing" and "prohibiting and permitting", and the implications of Yeshua's statement "I did not come to abolish the Torah". Gordon also provides a comparison table of selected verses from the Hebrew and Greek versions of Matthew, highlighting the discrepancies and contradictions between them.
  
Whether you agree or disagree with Gordon's conclusions, you will find this book to be a stimulating and thought-provoking read that will make you reconsider some of your beliefs and assumptions about Yeshua and his teachings. As one reader on Goodreads commented, "This book is a well written treatise placing Yeshua in the Hebraic culture in which He was raised, thereby adding better understanding and clarity to Yeshuaâs words in the Semitic context of that period"[^3^]. If you are looking for a fresh and original perspective on Yeshua and his relationship to Judaism, you should definitely check out *The Hebrew Yeshua Vs. The Greek Jesus Book Pdf*.

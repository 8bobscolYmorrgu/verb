## Improved Result Evaluation and Visualization
 
One of the main focuses of MAGMASOFT Magma 5.2 54 is to increase the efficiency in evaluating simulation results. Users can now compare up to four different project versions in the result perspective, and animate filling, solidification, and stress results in a synchronized mode. A special feature is the option to display the geometry and all MAGMASOFT results in 3D stereo using shutter or red/cyan glasses and to store them as 3D images or movies.
 
Various new tools facilitate a standardized result evaluation. New result criteria allow for a more effective evaluation of metal cooling and critical metal speeds during filling. The progress of feeding and porosity formation can be monitored and displayed continuously during the entire solidification process. A new criterion to predict cold cracks allows users to find stress-related casting quality problems more quickly.
 
The implementation of user results offers a powerful tool to compile user-specific criteria based on any MAGMASOFT results. User results can easily be defined and created automatically during a simulation or subsequently in the result perspective.
 
## Enhanced Die Casting Capabilities
 
Die casting users will appreciate an improved visualization of the process time line and extended consideration of the heat transfer conditions between die casting and die as a function of the local feeding conditions. Additionally, the MAGMAhpdc module now supports the assessment of the real casting temperature as a function of the current shot sleeve conditions.

All users will benefit from the new resume point capability, which allows flexibility in re-starting the simulation with modified die casting process conditions based on the previous or next-to-last casting cycle. Sand casting processes can be resumed with different conditions at the end of any process stage.
 
## Simplified Enmeshment and Distortion Measurement
 
The automatic enmeshment of complex geometries is now further simplified by new enmeshment criteria and procedures. Stress simulation results can be prepared for faster post processing.
 
For the quantitative assessment of casting distortion in the measurement perspective, it is now possible to compare the virtual measurement with the real part geometry.
 
## New Database of Riser Sleeves
 
Finally, with MAGMASOFT Magma 5.2 54, a new database of riser sleeves, which were generated by ASK Chemicals, is available.

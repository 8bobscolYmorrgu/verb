But what if you want to play Donkey Kong 64 on your Wii console? You might think that you need to buy the game from the Wii Shop Channel, but unfortunately, Donkey Kong 64 is not available there. The reason is that the game has some technical issues that prevent it from running properly on the Wii's Virtual Console emulator. However, there is another way to play Donkey Kong 64 on Wii: using WAD files.
 
WAD files are basically packages that contain a game ROM and an emulator that can run it on the Wii. By installing a WAD file on your Wii, you can create a channel that will launch the game directly from the Wii Menu. This way, you can bypass the Virtual Console limitations and enjoy Donkey Kong 64 on your Wii.
 
But how do you get WAD files for Donkey Kong 64? And how do you install them on your Wii? Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. First, you need to have a homebrew-enabled Wii. This means that you need to install the Homebrew Channel on your Wii, which will allow you to run unofficial software on your console. You can find a guide on how to do this [here](https://wii.guide/).
2. Next, you need to download a WAD file for Donkey Kong 64. There are several sources where you can find WAD files for N64 games, but one of them is [this archive](https://archive.org/download/WII-WAD-N64). Look for the file named "Donkey Kong 64.wad" and download it to your computer.
3. Then, you need to copy the WAD file to your SD card or USB drive that you use with your Wii. Make sure to place it in a folder named "wad" on the root of your device.
4. After that, you need to install the WAD file on your Wii using a WAD manager. A WAD manager is a homebrew application that can install or uninstall WAD files on your Wii. One of the most popular WAD managers is [WAD Manager](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/WAD_Manager). Download it and copy it to the "apps" folder on your SD card or USB drive.
5. Finally, you need to launch the WAD manager from the Homebrew Channel and select the device where you stored the WAD file. Then, browse to the "wad" folder and select the "Donkey Kong 64.wad" file. Press A to install it and wait for the process to finish. Once done, you will see a new channel on your Wii Menu with the Donkey Kong 64 logo. Press A to start playing!

And that's it! You can now enjoy Donkey Kong 64 on your Wii with WAD files. Keep in mind that this method may not work perfectly for every game, and some games may have glitches or compatibility issues. Also, make sure to backup your Wii's NAND before installing any WAD files, as they can potentially brick your console if something goes wrong. Always use WAD files at your own risk and respect the original creators of the games.

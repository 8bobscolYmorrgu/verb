Adaptive Filter Theory covers a wide range of topics related to adaptive filtering and neural networks, such as:

- The fundamentals of linear systems, random processes, and spectrum analysis.
- The principles and algorithms of linear prediction, Kalman filtering, and tracking of time-varying systems.
- The design and implementation of least-mean-square (LMS), recursive-least-squares (RLS), and frequency-domain adaptive filters.
- The theory and applications of rotations and reflections, square-root adaptive filters, and order-recursive adaptive filters.
- The concepts and techniques of nonlinear adaptive filtering, back-propagation learning, and radial basis function networks.

The book is organized into four parts, each with several chapters that provide detailed explanations, examples, and exercises. The book also includes several appendices that review some mathematical topics and methods that are relevant to adaptive filtering and neural networks. The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners who want to learn more about the theory and practice of adaptive filtering and neural networks.

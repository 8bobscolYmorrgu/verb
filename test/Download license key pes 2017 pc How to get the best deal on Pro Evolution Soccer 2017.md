## Gameplay
 
PES 2017 is a game that focuses on the core aspects of soccer: passing, shooting, dribbling, defending, and scoring. The game offers a realistic and satisfying control system that lets you execute precise and creative moves with the ball. You can use the right stick to perform skill dribbles, the left trigger to control the ball with finesse, and the right trigger to sprint with speed. You can also use different types of passes and shots depending on the situation, such as through balls, lofted passes, low crosses, curling shots, and volleys.
 
The game also features an adaptive AI that learns from your playstyle and adjusts accordingly. The AI will try to exploit your weaknesses, counter your strengths, and create dynamic situations on the pitch. For example, if you tend to pass a lot to a certain player, the AI will mark him more tightly and intercept his passes. If you like to shoot from long range, the AI will close you down faster and block your shots. The AI will also change its tactics depending on the scoreline and the time left in the game.
 
The game also boasts a realistic physics system that affects the ball movement and the player collisions. The ball will bounce, spin, and curve depending on how you hit it and where it lands. The players will react to the ball and each other with natural animations and motions. You will see players stumble, fall, slide, tackle, celebrate, and argue with each other in a convincing manner.
 
## Graphics
 
PES 2017 uses the Fox Engine to deliver stunning graphics and animations for the game. The game features improved lighting, shadows, textures, and details for the stadiums, players, kits, and crowds. The game also captures the likeness and expressions of many famous players, such as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The game also supports 4K resolution for PC users who have powerful hardware.
 
The game also features realistic weather effects that change dynamically during the match. You will see raindrops falling on the pitch and players' hair, fog covering the field, snow accumulating on the ground, and wind affecting the ball trajectory. The weather will also affect the gameplay, as wet conditions will make the ball faster and slippery, while dry conditions will make it slower and heavier.
 
## Modes
 
PES 2017 offers a variety of modes for different types of players. You can play single matches or tournaments with your favorite teams and players in Exhibition Mode or Cup Mode. You can also create your own custom tournaments with your own rules and settings in League Mode or Custom Mode.
 
If you want to experience a more immersive career mode, you can try Master League or Become a Legend. In Master League, you can take control of a club and manage its finances, transfers, tactics, training, and matches. You can also create your own manager avatar and interact with other managers and players in cutscenes. In Become a Legend, you can create your own player avatar and start your journey from a rookie to a superstar. You can choose your position, skills, appearance, and personality for your player.

# Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics by Gillesania: A Review
 
Fluid mechanics and hydraulics are two branches of engineering that deal with the behavior of fluids, such as water, air, oil, and gas. Fluid mechanics focuses on the properties and motion of fluids, while hydraulics applies fluid mechanics to design and operate systems that use fluids to transmit power or perform work.
 
One of the popular books that covers these topics is Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics by DIT Gillesania. This book is intended for engineering students who are preparing for the board exam or who want to review the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and hydraulics. The book is divided into two parts: Part I covers fluid mechanics, while Part II covers hydraulics.

The book is written in a clear and concise manner, with illustrations and diagrams to aid understanding. The book also provides tips and tricks to solve common types of problems in fluid mechanics and hydraulics. The book is suitable for self-study or as a supplement to other textbooks on the subject.
 
Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics by DIT Gillesania is available in PDF format online[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] or in print from various bookstores. The book is a revised edition that incorporates the latest updates and corrections from the author. The book is a valuable resource for engineering students who want to master fluid mechanics and hydraulics.
  
In this section, we will review some of the key concepts and formulas from the book Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics by DIT Gillesania. We will also provide some examples and exercises to test your understanding.
 
## Fluid Properties
 
Fluids are substances that can flow and deform under applied forces. Fluids can be classified into liquids and gases. Liquids have a definite volume but no definite shape, while gases have no definite volume or shape. Some common properties of fluids are density, specific weight, specific gravity, viscosity, surface tension, and vapor pressure.
 
- Density (Ï) is the mass per unit volume of a fluid. It is expressed in kg/m or slug/ft. Density varies with temperature and pressure for most fluids, except for incompressible fluids such as water.
- Specific weight (Î³) is the weight per unit volume of a fluid. It is expressed in N/m or lb/ft. Specific weight is related to density by the equation Î³ = Ïg, where g is the gravitational acceleration.
- Specific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the density of a fluid to the density of a standard fluid, usually water at 4Â°C or air at standard conditions. Specific gravity is a dimensionless quantity that indicates how heavy or light a fluid is compared to water or air.
- Viscosity (Î¼) is the measure of the resistance of a fluid to deformation or flow. It is expressed in NÂ·s/m or lbÂ·s/ft. Viscosity depends on the molecular structure and interaction of the fluid. Viscosity decreases with increasing temperature for liquids, but increases with increasing temperature for gases.
- Surface tension (Ï) is the force per unit length acting on the surface of a fluid due to the cohesion of its molecules. It is expressed in N/m or lb/ft. Surface tension causes liquids to form spherical drops or bubbles, and to rise or fall in capillary tubes.
- Vapor pressure (p<sub>v</sub>) is the pressure exerted by the vapor molecules of a liquid at a given temperature. It is expressed in Pa or psi. Vapor pressure increases with increasing temperature for liquids, and indicates the tendency of a liquid to evaporate or boil.

### Example 1
 
A tank contains 100 L of water at 20Â°C and 100 L of oil at 20Â°C. The density of water is 998 kg/m, the density of oil is 850 kg/m, and the atmospheric pressure is 101 kPa. Determine:

1. The mass and weight of water and oil in the tank.
2. The specific gravity of water and oil.
3. The pressure at the bottom of the tank.
4. The force exerted by the water and oil on one side of the tank, assuming it has a rectangular cross-section with dimensions 1 m by 0.5 m.

### Solution 1
 
a) The mass and weight of water and oil in the tank are given by:
 
m<sub>w</sub> = Ï<sub>w</sub>V<sub>w</sub> = (998 kg/m)(0.1 m) = 99.8 kg  
 W<sub>w</sub> = Î³<sub>w</sub>V<sub>w</sub> = (Ï<sub>w</sub>gV<sub>w</sub>) = (998 kg/m)(9.81 m/s)(0.1 m) = 979 N  
 m<sub>o</sub> = Ï<sub>o</sub>V<sub>o</sub> = (850 kg/m)(0.1 m) = 85 kg  
 W<sub>o</sub> = Î³<sub>o</sub>V<sub>o</sub> = (Ï<sub>o</sub>gV<sub>o</sub>) = (850 kg/m<sup>3</sup>

One of the main features of BIAS FX is the dual signal path, which allows you to combine two different sets of amps, cabs, and mics in the same setup. This gives you a lot of flexibility and sonic options, as you can blend different tones and effects together. For example, you can use a clean amp with a chorus pedal on one path, and a distorted amp with a delay pedal on another path. You can also adjust the volume and pan of each path to create a stereo sound.
 
Another feature of BIAS FX is the integration with BIAS Amp, which is a software that lets you design your own custom amp models. You can tweak every aspect of your amp, from the preamp to the power amp, from the tubes to the transformers. You can also use the Amp Match feature to capture the tone of any real amp or recording. Once you have created your custom amp models in BIAS Amp, you can import them into BIAS FX and use them with any pedal or effect.
 
BIAS FX also comes with a huge collection of presets, both factory and online. You can browse through thousands of presets created by professional artists, engineers, and users on ToneCloud, which is a cloud-based platform where you can share and download presets. You can also create your own presets and upload them to ToneCloud for others to enjoy. You can also rate and comment on other people's presets and follow your favorite creators.

BIAS FX is not only a software, but also a mobile app that you can use on your iOS or Android devices. You can turn your smartphone or tablet into a portable guitar rig, with the same features and quality as the desktop version. You can connect your guitar to your device using an audio interface or a Bluetooth adapter, and use headphones or speakers to hear your sound. You can also sync your presets and settings across devices using ToneCloud.

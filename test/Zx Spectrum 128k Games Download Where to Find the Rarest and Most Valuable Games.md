# How to Download and Play ZX Spectrum 128k Games on Your PC
 
If you are a fan of retro gaming, you might have heard of the ZX Spectrum, one of the most popular home computers in the UK in the 1980s. The ZX Spectrum had a huge library of games, ranging from arcade classics to adventure games, from platformers to shoot 'em ups. Many of these games were designed for the 48k model, but some were enhanced for the 128k model, which had more memory, better sound and a built-in joystick port.
 
But how can you play these games today? You might think that you need to find an old ZX Spectrum and a cassette player, but there is an easier way: you can use an emulator. An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of another system, allowing you to run games and programs on your PC. There are many emulators available for the ZX Spectrum, but one of the most popular and easy to use is Fuse.

# Human Zbuilder: A Plugin for Zbrush to Create Detailed Human Models
 
Human Zbuilder is a plugin for Zbrush that allows you to create realistic and high-polygon human models without any Zbrush skills. You can choose from a variety of presets and customize the shape, color, texture, and accessories of your model. You can also export your model as an OBJ file or a Ztool file for further editing in Zbrush or other software.
 
Human Zbuilder was created by Tsvetomir Georgiev, a digital sculptor and character artist who has worked on projects such as The Expendables 2, Conan the Barbarian, Olympus Has Fallen, and more. He has also released other plugins for Zbrush such as Zbuilder 4, which is a similar tool for creating creature models.

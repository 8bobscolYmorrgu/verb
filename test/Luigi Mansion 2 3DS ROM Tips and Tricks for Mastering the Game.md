# How to Download and Play Luigi's Mansion 2 on Nintendo 3DS
 
Luigi's Mansion 2, also known as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon in North America, is a sequel to the original Luigi's Mansion game for the Nintendo GameCube. In this game, Luigi has to explore five different haunted mansions and capture ghosts using his trusty Poltergust 5000 vacuum cleaner. The game features a variety of puzzles, secrets, and collectibles to discover, as well as a multiplayer mode where up to four players can team up and hunt ghosts together.
 
If you want to play Luigi's Mansion 2 on your Nintendo 3DS, you have two options: you can either buy a physical copy of the game from a store or online retailer, or you can download a digital copy of the game from the Nintendo eShop. However, if you don't have access to either of these options, or if you want to play the game on a different device, such as a PC or a smartphone, you can also use a 3DS emulator and a ROM file.

A 3DS emulator is a software that mimics the functionality of a real 3DS console, allowing you to run 3DS games on your device. A ROM file is a digital copy of a game cartridge, which contains all the data and information needed to play the game. To use a 3DS emulator and a ROM file, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download a 3DS emulator of your choice. There are many options available online, such as Citra, RetroArch, or NoxPlayer. Make sure to choose an emulator that is compatible with your device and has good performance and features.
2. Download a ROM file of Luigi's Mansion 2. You can find many sources online that offer ROM files for various games, such as Ziperto[^1^], Romhere[^2^], Archive[^3^], or EmuGen[^4^]. Make sure to choose a ROM file that matches your region and language preferences.
3. Extract the ROM file from the compressed archive using a software like WinRAR or 7zip. You should get a file with the extension .3ds or .cia.
4. Launch your 3DS emulator and load the ROM file. Depending on your emulator settings, you may need to configure some options, such as controls, graphics, sound, or cheats.
5. Enjoy playing Luigi's Mansion 2 on your device!

Note: Downloading and using ROM files may be illegal in some countries if you don't own the original game. Please check your local laws before proceeding.

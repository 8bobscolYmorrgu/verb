Features [ edit] FIFA 13 is not just a simple update of the previous game, but a game that introduces many new features and improvements to the FIFA franchise. Some of the most notable features are:

- First Touch Control: This feature makes the ball control more realistic and challenging, as the players have to deal with the unpredictability of the ball's bounce, spin, and speed. The first touch can make or break an attack, depending on the skill and timing of the player.
- Player Impact Engine: This feature enhances the physical interactions between the players on the pitch, such as collisions, tackles, pushes, and pulls. The Player Impact Engine also affects the injuries and fatigue of the players, making them more prone to mistakes and injuries.
- Complete Dribbling: This feature allows the players to have more freedom and creativity in dribbling, as they can use precise touches, feints, and turns to beat the defenders. The players can also change direction and speed quickly, making it harder for the opponents to predict their moves.
- Attacking Intelligence: This feature improves the intelligence and positioning of the attackers, as they can analyze the space and create more opportunities for themselves and their teammates. The attackers can also curve their runs to stay onside, or time their runs to break the offside trap.
- Kinect and PlayStation Move Support: This feature enables the players to use voice commands and gestures to control some aspects of the game, such as changing tactics, formations, or substitutions. The players can also use voice commands to interact with the referee and their teammates, but they have to be careful not to swear or insult them, as this can affect their performance and morale.

FIFA 13 is a game that offers a realistic and immersive football experience for fans of all ages and skill levels. Whether you want to play solo or with your friends online or offline, FIFA 13 has something for everyone. Download FIFA 13 today and enjoy the beautiful game!

Pamphlet Architecture 15: War and Architecture is a book by architect and theorist Lebbeus Woods, published by Princeton Architectural Press in 1993. The book is a response to the bombing of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War, and presents a series of drawings and texts that explore the relationship between architecture and violence. The book is written in both English and Croatian, and is dedicated to the citizens of Sarajevo.
 
Woods argues that war and architecture are intimately connected, and that the conventional patterns of rebuilding cities after destruction are forms of denial. He proposes alternative architectural forms that act as "injections," "scabs," "scars," and "new tissue," within the complex organism of a city. He challenges architects to face the insanity of willful destruction, and to use their creativity to imagine new possibilities for urban life.

The author of Pamphlet Architecture 15: War and Architecture, Lebbeus Woods, was an American architect and artist who was born in 1940 and died in 2012. He was known for his unconventional and experimental designs, which were mostly unbuilt but had a significant impact on the architectural discourse. He was interested in exploring the role of architecture in situations of crisis, conflict, and change, and challenging the norms and conventions of the profession. He was also influenced by philosophy, mathematics, science fiction, and art. [^1^] [^2^] [^3^]
 
Woods studied architecture at the University of Illinois and engineering at Purdue University. He worked briefly for Eero Saarinen and other firms before turning to theory and experimental projects in 1976. He taught architecture at the Cooper Union in New York City and at the European Graduate School in Switzerland. He also co-founded the Research Institute for Experimental Architecture, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing experimental architectural thought and practice. He published nine books and received several awards and honors for his work. [^1^] [^2^]
 
Some of his most notable projects include A-City (1987), a visionary city that adapts to its environment; Centricity (1988), a series of urban interventions that challenge the notion of centrality; Underground Berlin (1990), a proposal for a subterranean network of spaces in the divided city; San Francisco Project: Inhabiting the Quake (1995), a design for a seismic urbanism that responds to earthquakes; Havana Project (1999), a collaboration with local architects to create new forms of housing and public space; Light Pavilion (2013), a luminous structure inserted into a building by Steven Holl in Chengdu, China; and System Wien (2005), a radical transformation of Vienna's urban fabric.

Katyar Kaljat Ghusali is a 2015 Marathi film based on a play by the same name. Directed by Subodh Bhave, the film stars Sachin Pilgaonkar, Shankar Mahadevan, and Subodh Bhave in lead roles. The film marks the directorial debut for Bhave, and the theatrical acting debut for Shankar Mahadevan. The original play, written by Purushottam Darvhekar, premiered in 1967 in Mumbai, where Hindustani classical vocalist Vasantrao Deshpande played one of the protagonists. In 2010, the play was relaunched with protagonists essayed by Rahul Deshpande, grandson of Vasantrao Deshpande and singer Mahesh Kale. The film's music is composed by ShankarâEhsaanâLoy, and retained some of the songs from the original play composed by Jitendra Abhisheki.
 
The film is set during the British Raj era and revolves around the rivalry between two classical singers, Pandit Bhanu Shankar Shastri (Shankar Mahadevan) and Khansaheb Aftab Hussain Bareliwale (Sachin Pilgaonkar). Shastri is a royal singer of the princely state of Vishrampur and enjoys the status and privileges that come with it. He is challenged by Khansaheb, a talented but arrogant singer from Miraj, who wants to dethrone him and claim his position. The Maharaja of Vishrampur arranges an annual singing competition on Dasara festival, where the winner is awarded a katyar (dagger) that grants him the right to kill one person in self-defense. Shastri defeats Khansaheb for fourteen consecutive years, until he is poisoned by Khansaheb's wife Nabila (Sakshi Tanwar) and loses his voice. Khansaheb becomes the royal singer and moves to the haveli (mansion) with his daughter Zareena (Amruta Khanvilkar), while Shastri leaves the village without informing anyone.

Years later, Shastri's daughter Uma (Mrunmayee Deshpande) meets Sadashiv (Subodh Bhave), a disciple of Khansaheb who is disillusioned with his guru's arrogance and cruelty. Sadashiv learns that Shastri is still alive and living in a nearby village as a teacher. He convinces Uma to bring her father back to Vishrampur and challenge Khansaheb for the katyar. Shastri agrees to return but only on one condition: he will not sing but teach Sadashiv to sing in his place. Sadashiv accepts the challenge and begins his training under Shastri. Meanwhile, Zareena falls in love with Sadashiv and tries to persuade him to give up his quest for revenge. She also tries to reconcile her father with Shastri, but Khansaheb refuses to forgive or forget his old rival.
 
The film culminates in a climactic musical duel between Sadashiv and Khansaheb on Dasara festival, where both singers display their mastery of classical music and their devotion to their gurus. The outcome of the duel will decide the fate of the katyar, the haveli, and the lives of all involved.

# How to use FFVCL â Delphi FFmpeg VCL Components with Crack
 
FFVCL is a native VCL components suit that wraps FFmpeg libraries for converting and playing audio and video files. It is more easy, more flexible and more powerful than the official FFmpeg command line interface. However, it is not free and requires a license to use. In this article, we will show you how to use FFVCL with crack to bypass the license check and enjoy its features.

## Step 1: Download FFVCL and Crack
 
The first step is to download the latest version of FFVCL from its official website[^1^]. You can choose the version that matches your Delphi version and platform. The download file is a zip archive that contains the installer and the documentation.

The next step is to download the crack file from a reliable source. The crack file is usually a DLL file that replaces the original one in the FFVCL installation folder. You can search for "ffvcl delphi ffmpeg vcl components crack" on Google or other search engines and find some links that offer the crack file. For example, we found one link[^2^] that provides the crack file for Delphi 10.4 Sydney.
 
## Step 2: Install FFVCL and Replace DLL
 
The second step is to install FFVCL on your computer. You can run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to specify the installation folder and the Delphi version that you want to install FFVCL for. The installer will also register the components in the IDE.
 
The next step is to replace the original DLL file with the cracked one. You can find the original DLL file in the installation folder of FFVCL, under the subfolder "bin". The name of the DLL file depends on your Delphi version and platform. For example, for Delphi 10.4 Sydney 32-bit, the DLL file name is "FFVCL\_D104.dll". You can rename or backup the original DLL file and then copy and paste the cracked DLL file in its place.
 
## Step 3: Use FFVCL in Your Projects
 
The final step is to use FFVCL in your projects. You can open Delphi IDE and create a new project or open an existing one. You can find FFVCL components in the component palette under "FFVCL" category. You can drag and drop them on your forms and set their properties and events as you like. You can also refer to the documentation[^1^] for more details on how to use each component.
 
With FFVCL crack, you should be able to use all the features of FFVCL without any license check or limitation. However, you may encounter some risks or problems such as:
 
- Virus or malware infection: The crack file may contain malicious code that can harm your computer or steal your data.
- Legal issues: The crack file may violate the copyright or license agreement of FFVCL and expose you to legal consequences.
- Compatibility issues: The crack file may not work with newer versions of FFVCL or Delphi or cause some errors or bugs.
- Lack of support: The crack file may not receive any updates or fixes from the developers or community.

Therefore, we recommend you to use FFVCL with crack at your own risk and discretion.

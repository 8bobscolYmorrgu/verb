## What is Computer Graphics with OpenGL 3rd Edition by Donald Hearn and Pauline Baker?
 
**Computer Graphics with OpenGL 3rd Edition by Donald Hearn and Pauline Baker** is a textbook that teaches the principles and techniques of computer graphics. It is suitable for students who are taking an introductory course in computer graphics or who want to learn more about the subject on their own.
 
The book is divided into three parts. The first part covers the basic concepts of computer graphics, such as coordinate systems, vectors, matrices, transformations, projections, clipping, and rasterization. The second part focuses on the OpenGL programming library, which is a cross-platform API for creating 2D and 3D graphics. The book explains how to use OpenGL to create simple graphics programs, such as drawing points, lines, polygons, curves, surfaces, and images. The third part explores more advanced topics in computer graphics, such as lighting models, shading algorithms, texture mapping, hidden surface removal, antialiasing, ray tracing, and animation.

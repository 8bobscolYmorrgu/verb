Kitab Al-fiqh Al-islami Wa Adillatuhu is divided into eight volumes in Arabic and ten volumes in Indonesian. The first volume deals with the sources and principles of Islamic law, the second volume covers the acts of worship (ibadah), the third volume discusses the transactions and contracts (mu'amalat), the fourth volume covers the family law (munakahat), the fifth volume deals with the penal law (jinayat), the sixth volume covers the inheritance law (faraidh), the seventh volume discusses the endowments and trusts (waqf and hibah), and the eighth volume covers the judicial system and legal maxims (qada' and qawa'id).
 
The book is widely praised for its comprehensiveness, clarity, objectivity and authenticity. It is considered one of the most important references on Islamic law in the modern era. It is suitable for students, scholars, judges, lawyers and anyone who wants to learn about the Islamic legal system. The book also contains many examples, cases, diagrams and tables to illustrate the concepts and rules of Islamic law.
 
However, some critics have pointed out some drawbacks of the book, such as its length, complexity, repetition and occasional bias. Some have also argued that the book does not adequately address some contemporary issues and challenges facing Muslims in different contexts and cultures. Some have also suggested that the book should be updated and revised to reflect the latest developments and research in Islamic law.
  
In conclusion, Kitab Al-fiqh Al-islami Wa Adillatuhu is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn about Islamic law in depth and breadth. It covers the main topics and issues of Islamic law from various perspectives and evidences. It also provides a historical and comparative analysis of the development and evolution of Islamic law. It is a masterpiece of scholarship and research that reflects the author's vast knowledge and experience in the field of Islamic law.
 
However, the book is not without its limitations and challenges. It is a very long and complex book that requires a lot of time and effort to read and understand. It also has some repetitions and inconsistencies that may confuse or bore the reader. It also does not address some of the contemporary issues and problems that Muslims face in the modern world. It also needs to be updated and revised to incorporate the latest findings and opinions in Islamic law.
 
Therefore, the book should be read with an open mind and a critical eye. It should be appreciated for its strengths and contributions, but also criticized for its weaknesses and gaps. It should be used as a guide and a reference, but not as a final authority or a definitive answer. It should be supplemented with other sources and books that offer different perspectives and insights on Islamic law. It should be seen as a milestone and a challenge for further research and development in Islamic law.

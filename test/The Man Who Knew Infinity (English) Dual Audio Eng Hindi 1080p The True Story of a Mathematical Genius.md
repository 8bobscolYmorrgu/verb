Ramanujan's interest in mathematics was sparked by a book he borrowed from a friend when he was 15 years old. The book was a collection of mathematical results and formulas by George Shoobridge Carr, titled A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics. Ramanujan was fascinated by the book and began to work out the proofs and problems on his own, using a slate and chalk as he could not afford paper. He also started to discover new formulas and theorems by himself, without any formal training or guidance.

Ramanujan's mathematical talent soon caught the attention of some local mathematicians, who encouraged him to pursue his studies further. However, Ramanujan faced many difficulties in his academic career, as he neglected other subjects and failed to obtain a college degree. He also suffered from poverty and ill health, and had to rely on the support of his friends and benefactors. He married Janaki Ammal in 1909, when he was 21 years old.
 
In 1913, Ramanujan wrote a letter to G.H. Hardy, a famous mathematician at Cambridge University, enclosing some of his mathematical results. Hardy was amazed by Ramanujan's genius and invited him to come to England. Ramanujan agreed, despite his religious objections and his mother's initial resistance. He arrived in England in 1914 and began to work with Hardy at Trinity College. There he received recognition and respect from the British mathematical community, and published several papers in prestigious journals. He also became a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of Trinity College.
